NEEMB
=================

NEEMB is a boilerplate that provides a nice starting point for MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and Ember.js based applications which use Brunch.io way. 
An up-to-date [Brunch](http://brunch.io) skeleton for developing clean [Ember](http://emberjs.com) applications with ease.

It was based on the skeleton from Huafu Gandon [brunch-with-ember-and-bootstrap](https://github.com/huafu/brunch-with-ember-and-bootstrap) and
the skeleton from Giovanni Collazo [brunch-with-ember-reloaded](https://github.com/gcollazo/brunch-with-ember-reloaded) but is now much more updated and complex now, tho I'd prefer to keep my original source.

Also 

the skeleton from Jeremy Fowler [ExpressBrunchJade](https://github.com/jerfowler/ExpressBrunchJade)
and the skeleton from Elving Rodriguez [brunch-with-hipsters](https://github.com/elving/brunch-with-hipsters) 
which was used for organizing code of express application on Node.js

## Getting started
Create a new project using this skeleton:
```
git clone git@github.com:denya133/neemb.git <appname>
cd <appname>
brunch watch --server
```
Open [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) on your browser.


## Production release
To create a production release (smaller vendor files, js and css packed), use the cake build command:
```
cake build
```
It'll generate a production ready `public` and create an archive of it in `public.tgz` that you can then backup or send to your servers.


## Creating API documentation
You can easily create the API documentation fo your project using:
```
cake gen-doc
```
The API documentation will be generated in the `apidocs` folder. You can change this and other settings in `yuidoc.json`.


## Ember Data
The Ember Data is already included in the project but you need to activate it in the file `app/store.coffee`.

You can easily disable it by prepending `vendor/scripts/ember-data.js` with a `_`, removing it from the `config.coffee` file and commenting out `require 'store'` from `app/initialize.coffee`.


## Ember Bootstrap
[Ember Bootstrap](https://github.com/emberjs-addons/ember-bootstrap) is adding some helpers to use Twitter Bootstrap elements easy with Ember. It comes with Views accessible as Handlebars template helpers too.


## Generators
This skeleton makes use of [scaffolt](https://github.com/paulmillr/scaffolt#readme) generators to help you create common files quicker. To use first install scaffolt globally with `npm install -g scaffolt`. Then you can use the following command to generate files.

Generating files of Ember App

```
scaffolt model <name>              → app/models/Name.coffee
    => App.Name = DS.Model.extend

scaffolt view <name>               → app/views/Name.coffee
    => App.NameView = Ember.View.extend

scaffolt controller <name>         → app/controllers/Name.coffee
    => App.NameController = Ember.Controller.extend

scaffolt objectcontroller <name>   → app/controllers/Name.coffee
    => App.NameController = Ember.ObjectController.extend

scaffolt arraycontroller <name>    → app/controllers/Names.coffee
    => App.NamesController = Ember.ArrayController.extend

scaffolt route <name>              → app/routes/Name.coffee
    => App.NameRoute = Ember.Route.extend

scaffolt template <name>           → app/templates/name.hbs

scaffolt component <comp-name>     → app/templates/components/comp-name.hbs
                                   → app/views/components/CompName.coffee
    => App.CompNameComponent = Ember.Component.extend
```

Generating files of Express App

```
scaffolt express_route <name>		→ express/routes/name.coffee
		=> 	exports.name = (options) ->
				  (req, res) ->
				    res.render 'name', {options: options}

scaffolt express_view <name>		→ express/views/name.jade
		=> 	extends layout

				block content

				// {{name}}
```

* There's a few more commands you can use with `scaffolt` and also instruction on how to create your own generators, so make sure you check out the [docs](https://github.com/paulmillr/scaffolt#readme).
* Each generator will automatically add the generated files to the corresponding initializer coffee file so that you won't have to add them yourself.


## Testing
You can write your tests in the `test` folder, just make sure they are named `*_test.coffee`. You can customize the test to user PhantomJS, Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Opera on the `test/karma.conf.js` file. There's a lot of other settings there as well. Run tests with:

```
cake test
```
It needs some work to make it ready with `Ember`, and that will probably come in the next major release.


## Updating
You have some `cake` tasks to help you update *ember*, *ember-data* and *ember-bootstrap*. More to come in the future.
```bash
# update Ember:
cake update-ember
# update Ember Data:
cake update-ember-data
# update Ember Bootstrap:
cake update-ember-bootstrap
# update Twitter Bootstrap:
cake update-bootstrap
# update Font Awesome:
cake update-font-awesome
# get/update Ember Date:
cake update-ember-date
```
